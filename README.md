I’m here to create real relief for ordinary people—help that makes life clearer and lighter without trapping them—and to be known by the right people as someone who does that with integrity and craft. I thrive when I can make and refine real things with fast, legible proof and low mental burden for the user, and I avoid paths where progress depends on permission or prolonged self-justification rather than the work speaking for itself.
